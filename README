Description :
	TorchUI is a combination of jQuery plugins that provide a stable functional User Interface for Websites	and applications.  It's more than just JavaScript however.  It also formats the Browsers with special CSS files that will create a less hostile development platform.  Including a Grid Framework for proper professional Designs.

--------------------
---  INSTALLING
--------------------

Currently, the most simple way to explain how to install is to drop the files into your root path of a website, and then include them like this, 


	<link rel="stylesheet" href="torchui-site.css" type="text/css" />
	<script src="torchui-1.0.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

between the <head></head> tags of the html document.  Notice, you CAN pass the options for torchui within the script tags as long as it is in the object form shown.

jQuery is NOT required to be seperate, it's best to treat TorchUI as your jQuery installation.

--------------------
---  CONFIGURING
--------------------
Configuring can be found at the top of the TorchUI.js file... It's all there and very easy to follow in the comments.
